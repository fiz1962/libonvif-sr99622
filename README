                             INTRODUCTION

libonvif is a multi platform library implementing the client side of the ONVIF
specification for communicating with IP enabled compatible cameras.  It will
compile with GNU cc on Linux, macosx, and mingw.  A separate version is made for
Windows and is available in a zip download format, see libonvif on sourceforge
for more information.

An example program is included with libonvif that will discover compatible
cameras on the local network and query each of them for their RSTP connection
uri information.

                         DEPENDENCY ON LIBXML2

libonvif has a dependency on libxml2.  This means you will need to have libxml2
installed on your machine and you will need to know the location of the libxml2
include files for compilation.  Most systems come with libxml2 pre-
installed.  You can check the availability of libxml2 on your system with the
following command:
