                         DEPENDENCY ON LIBXML2

libonvif has a dependency on libxml2.  This means you will need to have libxml2
installed on your machine and you will need to know the location of the libxml2
include files for compilation.  Most systems come with libxml2 pre-
installed.  You can check the availability of libxml2 on your system with the
following command:

A file, "How to compile libxml2.txt" is included which shows how to compile this lib for use in Windows with both Visual Studio and mingw.  Alternatively you could use precompiled libs avaliable elsewhere.
